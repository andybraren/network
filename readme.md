# Maker Network

The Maker Network is a [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/)-based community website platform. It includes many of the features that new education-oriented makerspaces need, and integrates directly with the [RFID Network](https://github.com/JumbosMakerNetwork/RFID_Network) to make managing a makerspace easier.

## Features

- User profiles and accounts
- Frontend-editable pages (projects, spaces, equipment, etc.)
- Private group pages
- RFID integration
